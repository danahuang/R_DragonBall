I have learned how to observe data and clean the data even training the data in different basic models. XGboost is the main model I need to further study since it's the most popular model in Kaggle.

Here are the notes in each day:

Day1:
Regular Expression

R cheatsheets
https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/
spread好用: transpose columns as dummy variables
strsplit重要，要知道如何切文字欄位並補值: https://medium.com/@kevinhsu_83500/r-learning-notes-parsing-%E5%AD%97%E4%B8%B2%E8%99%95%E7%90%86-587264518581

Day2:
把變數分數值和類別並畫圖
data.table好用

Day3:
featue engineering is very important!
Colunms that missing value w high property should be deleted.


what problems I faced in this event:
1. Not sure why use tidyverse package wo Id in Day3 R file when grouping the variables into a new variable. (It can be rn in Day1 file.)
