# R_DragonBall

I have learned how to observe data and clean the data even training the data in different basic models. XGboost is the main model I need to further study since it's the most popular model in Kaggle.

Here are the notes in each day:
Day1:
Regular Expression

R cheatsheets
https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/
spread好用: transpose columns as dummy variables

Day2:
把變數分數值和類別並畫圖
data.table好用

Day3:
featue engineering is very important!
Colunms that missing value w high property should be deleted.


what problems I faced in this event:
1. Not sure why use tidyverse package wo Id in Day3 R file when grouping the variables into a new variable. (It can be rn in Day1 file.)
