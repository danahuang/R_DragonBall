# R_DragonBall

I have learned how to observe data and clean the data even training the data in different basic models. XGboost is the main model I need to dig more since it's the most popular model in Kaggle.

what problems I faced in this event:
1. Not sure why use tidyverse package wo Id in Day3 R file when grouping the variables into a new variable. (It can be ran in Day1 file.)
